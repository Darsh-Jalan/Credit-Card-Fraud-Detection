# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Developed a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection using three plus sampling and model-building techniques.
Implemented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to spot anomalies, conducting SMOTE and ADASYN oversampling techniques to deal with class imbalance.
Evaluated models using Accuracy & AUC-ROC metrics, tuning hyper-parameters by deploying RandomizedsearchCV to get an accuracy of 99.8%.
